# The content in this page is generated from Weave

Everything below the horizontal line comes from Weave. Note that Weave uses its own CSS, but there's ambiguity between the CSS that should be used by the site and Weave's (which assumes you're generating a single, standalone page).
Here we copy some CSS (pertaining to the code) but you might want to do further modifications on the CSS e.g. if you want to adjust the layout (the classes used by Weave for the layout are ignored here).

Also note that Weave uses MathJax and so this page uses MathJax.

Generally speaking, if you want to use Weave, this should be a good starting point, you might have to adjust the CSS as indicated above to get a uniform experience across your site (e.g. similar code highlighting).

Note also that using Weave makes sense if you have existing notes in Weave or if you want to get some PDF output.
Otherwise you'd be better off justing using Franklin, possibly in combination with Literate.
